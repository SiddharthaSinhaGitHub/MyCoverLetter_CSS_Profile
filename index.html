<p>Dear Recruitment Team! </p>

<p>
I am writing to express my interest in your company. With a deep passion for technology and a strong commitment to continuous learning, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your innovative team and be part of a company that values transformation and challenges.
My professional journey has been shaped by a relentless drive for learning and growth, which aligns perfectly with Company's emphasis on being a "learnaholic." Over the past 2 years 5 months, I have honed my skills in backend python, working on projects that required adaptability, problem-solving, and a keen eye for detail. For instance, while working at Infosys, I led a team that developed a new feature for an open-source project, resulting increase in user engagement. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of collaboration and mentorship in driving innovation.
 
Your Company’s commitment to diversity and inclusion resonates deeply with me. Having worked in diverse and international teams, I have learned the value of different perspectives in fostering creativity and achieving excellence. I am particularly drawn to Company's culture of continuous transformation and challenge, which I believe is essential for personal and professional growth.
One of the aspects that excites me most about Company is your active contribution to the development and improvement of Open Source Software. I share this passion and have actively contributed to several open-source projects, including .Net full Stack, PowerShell, Angular. I believe that my background in backend python and my enthusiasm for open-source development will allow me to make meaningful contributions to your team.
 
Although I am not currently based in Japan, I am highly motivated to relocate due to my admiration for the country's rich technological landscape and culture. Japan’s reputation for innovation and excellence in technology is a significant draw for me, and I am eager to immerse myself in an environment that is at the forefront of technological advancements. Furthermore, I have always been fascinated by Japanese culture, particularly its emphasis on precision, respect, and continuous improvement—values that resonate deeply with my own personal and professional ethos. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to Company and grow within a dynamic and culturally enriching environment.
 
Your Company’s vision and mission are incredibly inspiring, and I am eager to align my career aspirations with the goals of your company. I am confident that my skills, combined with my dedication to continuous learning and growth, make me a strong fit for the backend python. I am excited about the possibility of joining Company and contributing to your ongoing success while furthering my own professional development.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and passions align with the needs of Company.
